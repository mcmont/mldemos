## Introduction
These demos will feature in an upcoming beginner-level talk about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

The demos are divided into:

*  Classifiers (binary, multiclass motion detection via *k*-nearest neighbours, radial basis function)
*  Natural language processing (NLP)
*  Image recognition via Azure Face API

Each demo has its own README.md file that contains information about how to install the dependencies for, and run, the demo.
