## Introduction
I created these demos for various artificial intelligence and machine learning talks that I've given at Infinity Works.

The demos are:

* Classifiers (binary, multiclass motion detection via *k*-nearest neighbours, radial basis function)
* Natural language processing (NLP)
* Image recognition via Azure Face API
* Human Pie Divider - dividing people into groups based on their answers to a questionnaire

Each demo has its own README.md file to explain how to install the dependencies for, and run, the demo.
